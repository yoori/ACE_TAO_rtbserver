	This directory contains what possibly is the simplest example
for a COS Event Service.  It contains three executables; a consumer,
supplier and a program to create the event channel itself.

	To test is use the run_test.pl script, or:

$ ./Service -o ec.ior
$ ./Consumer file://ec.ior
$ ./Supplier file://ec.ior

	more advanced tests are located in:

$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/CosEvent
