// This file is here to avoid the use of VPATH.  Since the TAO_IDL
// counterparts are built with a different BE_GlobalData definition, the
// object files built in the TAO_IDL directory are not usable in the
// IFRService.  The BE_GlobalData is larger in TAO_IDL than it is in
// IFRService which causes problems when be_global is deleted.
