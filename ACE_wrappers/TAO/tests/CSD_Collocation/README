This is the Collocation test adapted to use CSD, specifically CSD's thread-pool
(TP) stragegy.  Collocation.cpp has been modified to shut down and restart the
CORBA objects (POAs, ORBs) since that is the use case that shows this
particular bug.  Collocation_Tester.cpp has been modified to use a child POA,
which will use CSD TP when svc.conf.csd is used as the configuration file.
