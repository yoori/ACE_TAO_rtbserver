Description:
This is a simple test for a RT thread-pool server.  It creates a
server process with multiple thread pools, POAs, and servants.  The
test also spawns multiple clients for each servant.  The servants with
multiple threads in their thread-pool respond faster than the servants
with a single thread thread-pool.

See run_test.pl to see how to run this test.
